            Since you're here, it would be a great place to learn about HTTP Response Codes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" target="about:blank"> Wikipedia has something about it.</a> <br> <br>

            They are a code that the server sends back when you, the client, requests something. The 400s are client errors, which means <em>you</em> did something wrong. 404 is probably the most common,
            and it basically means that whatever you are trying to find doesn't exist. other examples are 504 Gateway Timeout, 200 Ok, and 418 I'm a teapot. (Coffee is much better than tea)
